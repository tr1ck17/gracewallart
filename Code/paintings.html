                            This is a painting of a jockey on a horse during a race. I took inspiration from a race that I watched on tv, after I found 
                            myself amazed at how physically detrimental the sport can be. The moment I saw was so intense, and I wanted to 
                            attempt to capture it myself. I used acrylic paint on a canvas to create this piece. 
                            I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the process.

                            This is a painting of Mary holding baby Jesus. I took inspiration from a painting that I saw in a church, and I wanted to
                            recreate my own depiction. This was created using oil and canvas, and took 96 hours to complete.

                            This is a painting of a terrier on a boat in the middle of a lake. 
                            The original image is of a photo taken of this dog found on the internet.
